# The Datasets:
We have four datasets. Each one is in a separate folder. The datasets are:
1. Abortion
2. Gun 
3. Super Bowl
4. SXSW

All the files are the `.feather` format. It's a binary format that is very fast to read and write. You can read more about it [here](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html). To work with them you need to use `pandas` and `pyarrow` libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow
```
